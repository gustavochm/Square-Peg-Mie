# Supplementary information: "Fitting a Square Peg in a Round Hole: parameterisation of quasi-spherical molecules employing the Mie potential" by Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. MÃ¼ller.

This repository is part of the supplementary data of the article "Fitting a Square Peg in a Round Hole: parameterisation of quasi-spherical molecules employing the Mie potential". This repository includes scripts and ANN-based models to reproduce the results of the article.

The following folders are included:
1. [Calculation scripts](./1_calculation_scripts). This folder includes the Jupyter notebooks used to parameterise the Mie potential for several quasi-spherical molecules. The results are ultimately saved in the [computed_files](./computed_files/) folder.
1. [Plotting scripts](./2_plotting_scripts/). This folder includes the scripts to reproduce the figures of the article. These scripts read the data available in the [computed_files](./computed_files/) folder and save the figures in the [figures](./figures/) folder.
1. [python_helpers](./python_helpers/). This folder includes Python functions to use the FE-ANN EoS and the transport properties models.
1. [ann_models](./ann_models). This folder includes pre-trained ANN parameters for the FE-ANN EoS, FE-ANN(s) EoS and transport properties models. These models are updated versions of the original publications. Further details can be obtained from Gustavo's PhD thesis and this [repository](https://github.com/gustavochm/Chaparro-PhD-Thesis).
